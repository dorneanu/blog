      "Do you remember this [usd AG hacker challenge write-up](http://blog.dornea.nu/2015/03/18/usd-ag-hacker-challenge-2015-solutions/)? This years [hacking event](https://www.usd.de/akademie_/hackertag/) organized by the same company took place in **Hamburg**. 9 hackers all over Germany were invited to pwn&0wn all the things. Every team was assigned a certain IP range that had to be pentested. Every host identified within the IP range was **rootable**. And that's pretty much the information we had before conducting the pentest. My team got the IP range **10.10.10.20-29**. And now let's have a look at my notes I've taken during the hacking session."
