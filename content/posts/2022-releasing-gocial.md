More than a year ago I started working on a [side project](https://brainfck.org/t/deliberate-practice) born out of the furstration I had with [buffer](https://buffer.com/), [ifttt](https://ifttt.com/) and [zapier](https://zapier.com/). The use
case was pretty simple: I just wanted to share an article and some comments about it on
multiple social media platforms from a single location.

All sharing services had great functionalities (e.g. automated workflows)
{{% sidenote %}}
Initially I played with [RSS and hugo](/2022/06/13/rss-and-atom-for-digital-minimalists/#distribute-content) for publishing content via a RSS feed which
will then trigger posts on Twitter, LinkedIn &amp; co.
{{% /sidenote %}} but you're always limited in the number of shares you can distribute withing a time
frame without paying for premium. At the same time they all lacked support for LinkedIn
which then sparked the idea for [gocial](https://gocial.netlify.app/). After having a look at the [LinkedIn Post API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/community-management/shares/ugc-post-api?view=li-lms-unversioned&tabs=http)
{{% sidenote %}}
Which apparently now it's legacy and got replaced by the [posts API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/marketing/integrations/community-management/shares/posts-api?view=li-lms-2022-11&tabs=http).
{{% /sidenote %}} I decided I'll implement my own service in [Golang](/tags/golang) and learn more about
[OAuth](https://brainfck.org/t/OAuth) and [JWT](https://brainfck.org/t/JWT) tokens.

## Design {#design}

For the overall _system design_ I use a [serverless](https://brainfck.org/t/serverless) environment to run my Golang binary. Currently I use [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/) to host my Lambda function which serves all the functionalities via
HTTP and some REST API.

As for the _software architecture_ I've used [hexagonal architecture](https://brainfck.org/t/hexagonal-architecture)
to have more or less strict boundaries between the _domains_ and enable _lose coupling_.


### Sketching ideas {#sketching-ideas}

As always I've started with a rough idea how the code structure should like. Initially I wrote
down some ideas on my whiteboard
{{% sidenote %}}
And yeah, coding and drawing with kids is possible! ðŸ˜Š
{{% /sidenote %}} and codified these later on.

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2022/gocial/architecture-sketches.jpg" title="Early ideas" caption="This is how everything began. I've sketched some initial ideas before implementing the core parts." pos="left" >}}


### Hexagonal Architecture {#hexagonal-architecture}

I know the picture below doesn't look like an _hexagonal_ structure but it should at least emphasize what the _core domain_ is about.

{{< notice info >}}

I've recently release an online presentation on this topic. Checkout [Hexagonal Architecture (Basic Introduction using Python)](https://slides.dornea.nu/2022/hexagonal-architecture/).

## Project layout {#project-layout}

For the project structure/layout I've decided to go with this structure:

```text
gocial:

â”œâ”€â”€ cli
â”œâ”€â”€ docs
â”œâ”€â”€ internal
â”œâ”€â”€ lambda
â””â”€â”€ server
```
<div class="src-block-caption">
  <span class="src-block-number">Code Snippet 1:</span>
  Overall project structure
</div>


### `/internal` {#internal}

This is where the _gocial_ specific domain code goes to. This includes _entities_, different _services_ and the _authentication_ part.

```text
  ./internal
  â”œâ”€â”€ config
  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ config.go
  â”œâ”€â”€ entity
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ identity.go
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ providers.go
  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ share.go
  â”œâ”€â”€ identity
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ cookie_repository.go
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ file_repository.go
  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ repository.go
  â”œâ”€â”€ jwt
  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ token.go
  â”œâ”€â”€ oauth
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ goth_repository.go
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ repository.go
  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ service.go
  â””â”€â”€ share
      â”œâ”€â”€ linkedin_repository.go
      â”œâ”€â”€ repository.go
      â”œâ”€â”€ service.go
      â””â”€â”€ twitter_repository.go
```


### `/server` {#server}

```text
  ./server
  â”œâ”€â”€ api.go
  â”œâ”€â”€ html
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ html.go
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ postcss.config.js
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ static
  â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ main.css
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.css
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.js
  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ templates
  â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ about.html
  â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ auth
  â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ base.html
  â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
  â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ partials
  â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ share
  â”œâ”€â”€ http.go
  â”œâ”€â”€ oauth.go
  â””â”€â”€ share.go
```

This folder contains HTTP server specific functionalities:

-   `/html`
    -   here I put all the HTML templates and components (partials)
    -   I use [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) so there is a little bit of `npm` foo
-   `http.go`
    -   responsible for launching the HTTP server and setting up API routes
    -   renders HTML templates
-   `api.go`
    -   handles different API routes (e.g. sharing articles/comments)
-   `oauth.go`
    -   defines API endpoints for doing OAuth
