As another year comes to an end, it's time for my annual [review](/tags/review) (check out [2021](/2021/12/13/my-2021-review/), [2023](/2024/01/02/my-2023-review/)) - a
tradition where I reflect on the past twelve months, examining what I've **learned**, how I've
**grown**, and whether I've managed to stick to my **goals**. These reviews serve as a personal
chronicle but also a way to share experiences that might resonate with others on similar
journeys.

2024 has been a year of significant transitions and new beginnings. Perhaps the most
noteworthy change came in my professional life, where I stepped into a more _software
engineering-focused role_. This transition brought an exciting opportunity to contribute to
a large open-source [project](https://github.com/cloudoperators/heureka) - something that has opened new horizons for learning and
collaboration.

In an effort to share knowledge and best practices, I launched [defersec.com](https://defersec.com), a platform
dedicated to **DevSecOps** principles with a particular focus on the [Golang](https://brainfck.org/t/golang)
ecosystem. This project has allowed me to combine my passion for security with practical
implementation guidance. Along this journey, I've had the chance to deepen my expertise in
infrastructure as code, particularly with [Terraform](https://brainfck.org/t/terraform), while also
exploring the world of [Kubernetes](https://brainfck.org/t/kubernetes).

Beyond the technical realm, this year brought musical adventures I hadn't anticipated.
Learning to play the **bongos** evolved into taking Afro-Cuban Rumba classes for **congas** - a
journey that has added new rhythms and joy to my life.

Looking back, 2024 has been remarkably fulfilling - a year characterized by growth,
learning, and shared experiences with wonderful people. As we dive into the details of
this year's journey, I'll explore how various aspects of my life have evolved, from
productivity systems to daily habits, and from technical skills to creative pursuits.


## Goals {#goals}

As another year comes to an end, it's time to look back at the [goals I set for 2024](/2024/01/02/my-2023-review/#goals) and
think about what lies ahead. This reflection helps me understand not just what I've
achieved, but also how my interests and priorities have evolved throughout the year.

Some goals remained aspirational. The tool for auditing GitHub repository security
settings is still on the drawing board. I've been thinking whether to develop it as a
standalone application or integrate it into existing frameworks like Steampipe.
{{% sidenote %}}
Which already has some [Github integrations](https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-plugin-github)
{{% /sidenote %}} My "[Documentation as Code](/2023/07/18/documentation-as-code-for-cloud/)" series took an unexpected turn. While I initially was a
[Plantuml](https://brainfck.org/t/plantuml) advocate, I found myself gravitating more and more towards
[Mermaid charts](https://mermaid.js.org/) (also after having to write some ADRs where, of course, I've added some
diagrams). Its seamless integration with GitHub - automatic rendering in Markdown
documents ðŸ˜Ž - proved to be a killer feature. This shift made me reconsider my plans to
explore [D2Lang](https://d2lang.com/), as _Mermaid_ seems to better align with my current needs.


#### Music {#music}

Back in 2023 my thoughts were:

This year marked a significant milestone in my _musical journey_. After starting with _Bongos_
last year, I dove deeper into _Latin percussion_ by taking Rumba classes on _Congas_. The
world of _digital music_ also opened up to me: I've experimented with _live looping_ and
learned my way around [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), a cross-platform _DAW_ (Digital Audio Workstation). A
particular highlight was discovering [Koala Sampler](https://www.koalasampler.com/), which completely transformed my
approach to _live looping_ and _sampling_.


### Goals for 2025 {#goals-for-2025}


#### Technical Projects {#technical-projects}

Looking ahead, I've identified several key areas for _technical growth_:

<!--list-separator-->

-  **Kubernetes exploration**

    K8s remains a knowledge gap I'm more than determined to address. I'll again follow a "slow
    productivity" approach:

    -   Start with small-scale experiments using [k3s](https://k3s.io/)/[k3d](https://k3d.io/stable/)
    -   Work towards deploying my own little cluster, either on a VPS or locally
    -   Build practical experience through hands-on projects

    And I still need to finish [Kubernetes in Action](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34013922-kubernetes-in-action) which is really a great about if you want to learn about Kubernetes.

<!--list-separator-->

-  **Golang deep dive**

    With my recent transition towards more _Software Engineering_-focused tasks, I'm planning to
    strengthen my [Golang](https://brainfck.org/t/golang) expertise. There are 2 specific areas I'd like to
    know more about:

    -   _Generics_: This remains somewhat of a black box that I need to illuminate more
    -   _Concurrency_: Beyond basic understanding, I want to explore and implement common patterns
        that can be applied across different problems

<!--list-separator-->

-  **Security tooling**

    The GitHub repository security checker is still on my radar. With the rise of LLMs, I
    believe much of the _foundational work_ (authentication, API interactions) can be
    implemented easily. The key focus will be on defining comprehensive _security and compliance
    checks_ that provide real value to the users.


#### Music {#music}

My percussion journey continues with a focus on _Congas_. I've already invested in some
"Compact Congas" (Giovanni Hidalgo model) that fit perfectly in my space. I believe Congas
offer more "flexibility" than Bongos for song accompaniment (and solos!), and I'm
particularly excited to explore _Salsa_ music, though I'm keeping my options open for other
styles.

The _acoustic guitar_ hasn't been forgotten - I still pick it up regularly. However, I'm
considering taking formal lessons to improve, especially in finger-style playing. But who
knows if I'll ever get the chance to do this at all ðŸ¤·


## Productivity {#productivity}

After years of experimenting with various productivity systems, 2024 was the year where
things finally clicked into place. Countless hours of listening to [Cal Newport's podcast](https://calnewport.com/podcasts/)
on [slow productivity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197773418-slow-productivity) helped me internalize key concepts like **multi-scale planning**, **time
blocking**, and [deep work](https://brainfck.org/t/deep-work). This evolution in my approach has
fundamentally changed how I structure my days and manage my projects.


### Analog Tools still a thing {#analog-tools-still-a-thing}

The return to my _bullet journal_ has been transformative. While digital tools have their
place, there's something uniquely effective about _pen and paper_ for certain tasks. Just
the simple physical act of writing helps me process information differently and creates a
stronger connection to my plans and ideas. This way I also don't fully rely on laptops &amp;
PCs.


#### Time blocking in practice {#time-blocking-in-practice}

One of the most significant changes has been implementing _regular time blocking_. This
practice has helped me:

-   _Visualize_ my daily resources more effectively
-   Be more realistic about what can be accomplished
-   _Mentally prepare_ for the day ahead before diving into tasks


#### The power of paper {#the-power-of-paper}

Despite our digital age, collecting ideas, notes, and TODOs using pen and paper remains
unbeatable for several reasons:

-   Meeting notes can be quickly written down easily and fast
-   Spontaneous ideas can be captured immediately
-   No need to open a laptop for quick captures
-   The tactile experience helps with memory and processing


#### Weekly planning with Frankenlog {#weekly-planning-with-frankenlog}

My weekly planning has evolved with the adoption of a "[Frankenlog](https://frankenlog.com/how-it-works/)" style structure. This
system allows me to:

-   Assign specific days to tasks and appointments
-   Maintain a clear overview of the week
-   Review daily what needs to be accomplished that week
-   Adjust plans flexibly as circumstances change


### Digital organization with ORG mode {#digital-organization-with-org-mode}

While embracing analog tools, I've also refined my digital organization using [ORG mode](https://orgmode.org/) in
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). The system has evolved to become more structured and efficient.

-   **Project structure**

    My current project organization follows a clear pattern:
    ```org
    â€‹* PROJ Project 1
    â€‹  * Tasks
    â€‹    * TODO Do this and that
    â€‹  * Resources
    â€‹* PROJ Project 2
    â€‹  * Tasks
    â€‹    * TODO Do something else
    â€‹  * Resources
    ```
    <div class="src-block-caption">
      <span class="src-block-number">Code Snippet 1:</span>
      Project structure
    </div>

    This structure provides a clear separation between active tasks and reference materials,
    making it easier to focus on what needs to be done while keeping relevant resources
    readily accessible.

-   **Multi-Scale Planning in Practice**

    The implementation of multi-scale planning has become more sophisticated:
    ```org
    â€‹* 2024
    â€‹  * 2024-10
    â€‹  * 2024-11
    â€‹  * 2024-12
    â€‹    * wk49
    â€‹      * DONE I've done this!
    â€‹      * DONE Also this is done.
    â€‹    * wk50
    â€‹      * TODO Do this
    ```
    <div class="src-block-caption">
      <span class="src-block-number">Code Snippet 2:</span>
      Multi-Scale planning in ORG mode
    </div>

    This hierarchical approach offers several benefits:

    -   Tasks can be easily organized by week numbers
    -   Simple refiling between months and weeks
    -   Historical tracking of completed work
    -   Clear visibility of upcoming commitments


## Habits {#habits}

2024 marked a significant shift in how I approach _habit tracking_ and personal development.
While previous years were characterized by meticulous tracking using [Loop Habit Tracker](https://loophabits.org/),
this year I found myself gravitating towards a more intuitive approach. Sometimes, the
very act of tracking can add unnecessary mental stress to activities that should be
enjoyable and natural.

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2024/my-2024-review/garmin-intensity-minutes.png" title="Garmin intensity minutes" caption="" pos="left" >}}

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2024/my-2024-review/garmin-steps.png" title="Garmin Steps" caption="" pos="left" >}}


### Sports {#sports}

The year started with ambitious goals - I aimed to engage in sports twice weekly and
incorporate **20-minute daily exercise** sessions. Reality, however, had different plans. The
transition from a 30-hour to a 40-hour work week significantly impacted my exercise
routine, particularly affecting my regular Friday bouldering sessions.

The challenge with short daily exercise sessions wasn't about motivation alone - it was
more about the context switch I needed when working primarily _indoors_ (either at home or
in the office). The mental barrier of changing environments for a brief workout proved
to be more challenging than I thought.

One bright spot in my physical activity journey was discovering _rope flow_, a dynamic form
of movement that combines coordination, rhythm, and exercise. This practice has become an
engaging way to stay active while learning new skills.


### Reading {#reading}

My reading habit remains strong, though I've moved away from strict tracking. [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/121423977-victor-dorneanu)
continues to serve as my primary platform for keeping track of books, while the [Libby App](https://libbyapp.com/)
remains invaluable for accessing e-books and audiobooks from [VOEBB](https://voebb.de/) (my local library). My
trusty [Pocketbook Inkpad 3](https://pocketbook.de/inkpad-3-dark-brown), purchased in 2018, continues to be a reliable companion for
digital reading.

Here is reading list for [2024](https://brainfck.org/books/#2024):

-   Think Again (Adam Grant)
-   Domain Driven Design Quickly (Eric Evans &amp; various contributors)
-   Company of One (Paul Jarvis)
-   The Startup CTO's Handbook (Zach Goldberg)
-   The Minimalist Entrepreneur (Sahil Lavingia)
-   Lost Connections (Johann Hari)
-   Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind (Yuval Noah Harari)
-   Stolen Focus (Johann Hari)
-   When The Body Says No (Gabor MatÃ©)
-   Triggerpunkte (Christian HÃ¤fele)
-   The Ministry of the Future (Kim Stanley Robinson)
-   Elon Musk (Walter Isaacson)
-   Salz.Fett.SÃ¤ure.Hitze (Samin Nosrat)
-   Die Geschichte der Bienen (Maja Lunde)
-   Farm der Tiere (George Orwell - original title: Animal Farm)
-   The Effective Executive (Peter F. Drucker)
-   Warum Demokratien sterben (Steven Levitsky &amp; Daniel Ziblatt - original title: How Democracies Die)

I've also covered some book summaries:

-   [Book Summaries: January - April 2024](/2024/05/05/book-summaries-january-april-2024/)
-   [Book Summaries: May - September 2024](/2024/10/16/book-summaries-may-september-2024/)

There will be a last one (October - December) soon after this post. For a detailed look at
my 2024 reading journey, you can visit my [reading list](https://brainfck.org/books/#2024).


### Breathing techniques {#breathing-techniques}

This year was somehow an unintentional pause in my breathing practice. After actively
engaging with [Wim Hof](https://brainfck.org/book/the-wim-hof-method) and [Buteyko](https://brainfck.org/t/buteyko) methods
last year, 2024 has been, ironically, a "breathless" year. The same applies to _cold
showers_, which I previously used in conjunction with breathing techniques for preparation.

The change in my _morning routine_ might be responsible: I've adopted a gentler start to the
day (meditation, matÃ© tea) which, while peaceful, hasn't included the more challenging
breathing practices. There's potential to incorporate Buteyko breathing during walks,
something I might explore in the coming year.


### Meditation {#meditation}

My meditation practice had two distinct phases this year. The first half was notably
quiet, with barely any formal practice. However, the second half brought a significant
change with the discovery of the "[Waking Up](https://www.wakingup.com/)" app (a recommendation from the
[Huberman Lab podcast](https://www.hubermanlab.com/podcast)).

After previous experiences with [7Mind](https://www.7mind.de/) (primarily German content), "Waking Up" offered a
refreshingly direct approach to meditation. What sets it apart:

-   A "_bullshit-free_" approach to mindfulness
-   Diverse collection of _guided sessions_ from various speakers
-   Structured courses exploring _different techniques_
-   Thoughtful _discussions_ on philosophy, life, and meditation practice

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2024/my-2024-review/waking-up-dashboard.png" title="Waking Up " caption="" pos="left" >}}

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2024/my-2024-review/waking-up-stats.png" title="Waking Up Statistics" caption="" pos="left" >}}

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2024/my-2024-review/waking-up-explore.png" title="Waking Up Explore" caption="" pos="left" >}}

The impact has been profound: It helped me _regain focus_ and develop a healthier
relationship with my thoughts. Where before I struggled with an _overactive mind_ constantly
processing various thoughts and todos, I now find myself better able to maintain calm and
observe thoughts without getting engaged in them.

This evolution in my habits reflects a broader shift towards _quality over quantity_, and
authenticity over rigid tracking. While some practices have fallen away, others have
deepened, and new ones have emerged. It's a reminder that our habits should serve our
well-being rather than become another source of stress.


## Software I use {#software-i-use}

Inspired by [Software Tools I use](https://daryl.wakatara.com/tags/tools/) I thought I'll also start mentioning my tools I use daily
for work and personally. This year I've continued to refine my digital toolkit, focusing
on tools that enhance productivity while maintaining simplicity and efficiency in my
workflows.


### Daily drivers {#daily-drivers}

-   [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)

    Yes, of course. I've decided to go down the Emacs _rabbit-hole_ and have thoroughly
    "Emacsified" my workflows. While I'm fully aware of spending perhaps too much time
    tweaking my configuration, the result is a _system_ that perfectly aligns with my needs
    and working style. A significant milestone this year was transitioning to a _fully
    vanilla setup_, giving me complete control over my configuration.

-   [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

    Being on a Mac, I found myself returning to Alfred. Its snippet management and clipboard
    functionality have become indispensable parts of my daily workflow.
-   [Claude AI](https://claude.ai/)

    Claude has evolved into my virtual assistant for practically everything:

    -   Coding assistance
    -   Text summarization
    -   Recipe collection
    -   General writing assistance

        {{< gbox src="/posts/img/2024/my-2024-review/claude-emacs-discussions.png" title="Organize topic specific conversations into projects" caption="" pos="left" >}}

        {{< gbox src="/posts/img/2024/my-2024-review/claude-discussions-artefacts.png" title="Claude AI artefacts" caption="" pos="left" >}}

    As a premium user, I work directly with the interface rather than the API. While I
    occasionally use [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) (integrated into Emacs via [gptel](https://github.com/karthink/gptel)), Claude remains my primary AI
    assistant.

-   [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)

    As an ORG mode power user, synchronizing my files between devices is crucial. [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)
    elegantly handles this task, enabling seamless sync between:

    -   Multiple laptops
    -   Android smartphone
    -   Various ORG mode files and notes

    It's particularly useful for processing smartphone-collected notes and links on my
    laptop later.


### Sports {#sports}

-   [Garmin Forerunner 55](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/741137/pn/010-02562-01)

    {{< gbox src="/posts/img/2024/my-2024-review/garmin-watch-forerunner55.png" title="Garmin Forerunner 55" caption="Small and very handy" pos="left" >}}

    My touchscreen-free sports watch that perfectly meets my needs.

-   [GymRun](https://www.gymrun.app/)

    This app's integration with my Garmin watch has transformed my workout experience:

    -   Create custom routines/workouts
    -   Start workouts directly from the watch
    -   Train without smartphone dependency
    -   Eliminate decision fatigue before workouts

        {{< gbox src="/posts/img/2024/my-2024-review/gymrun-on-garmin.png" title="GymRun app on the Garmin watch" caption="" pos="left" >}}

    And the Android application:

    {{< gbox src="/posts/img/2024/my-2024-review/gymrun-workout-overview.png" title="GymRun Workout overview" caption="" pos="left" >}}


### Services {#services}

-   [Overdrive](https://www.overdrive.com/) / [Libbyapp](https://libbyapp.com/)

    An invaluable resource that I can't praise enough:

    -   Integration with local library membership
    -   Access to vast e-book and audiobook collections
    -   Magazine and newspaper availability
    -   Waitlist system for popular titles

        {{< gbox src="/posts/img/2024/my-2024-review/libby-hoalds.png" title="Libby Loans" caption="" pos="left" >}}

-   [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/)

    The kind of social media we need more of:

    -   Book discovery platform
    -   Reading progress tracking
    -   Community reviews and recommendations


### Applications {#applications}

-   [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/)
    -   an open source app store which contains applications, many of which are not available on the Play Store
    -   unline Google Play Store, F-Droid does not track user activity or collect data
-   [AntennaPod](https://antennapod.org/)
    -   it's open source
    -   this is my main driver for listening to podcasts
    -   it has a very intuitive UI

        {{< gbox src="/posts/img/2024/my-2024-review/antennapod-favorite-podcasts.png" title="AntennaPod - Favorite podcasts" caption="" pos="left" >}}

        {{< gbox src="/posts/img/2024/my-2024-review/antennapod-statistics.png" title="AntennaPod - Statistics" caption="" pos="left" >}}

-   [PipePipe](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/InfinityLoop1309.NewPipeEnhanced/)
    -   allows you to access Youtube videos
    -   you can play videos in the background (@Google: When do you finally acknowledge people don't want to see silly ads?)
    -   but the killer feature is still: _download_ videos

        -   I often do this to learn new Conga/Bongos patterns
        -   it's way easier to learn this way rather than coming back again and again to Youtube

        {{< gbox src="/posts/img/2024/my-2024-review/pipe-download-video.png" title="PipePipe - Download video" caption="" pos="left" >}}

-   [ABMT Music Trainer](http://www.sdfp-studio.com/)
    -   this app allows you to play local music/video files and create cue points, loops
    -   this way yo can easily jump to a certain point in the file

        -   very useful for jumping to specific portions of a video if you want to learn something
        -   I use it often to break down specific parts of a percurssion pattern and play them individually

        {{< gbox src="/posts/img/2024/my-2024-review/abmt-cue-points.png" title="ABMT Music Trainer" caption="" pos="left" >}}

-   [Infinity](https://github.com/Docile-Alligator/Infinity-For-Reddit) (reddit client)
    -   if you use reddit a lot this app offers you the most seamless experience
    -   you can customize your feed with filters, themes and more to tailor your reading experience
    -   no ads!
    -   what I like most is the "Hide Read Posts" which allows you to easily check _new_ posts (no infinite scrolling anymore)


### Devices {#devices}

-   **[Yubikey 5 NFC](https://www.yubico.com/us/product/yubikey-5-nfc/)**

    While not software per se, this tool is central to my digital security:

    -   Primary use as a smartcard for encryption/decryption and signing
        -   Encrypt/Decrypt ORG mode files
        -   Sign git commits
        -   Store authentication keys (e.g. for SSH)
    -   GPG agent proxying capability
        -   Access to emails on remote machines
        -   No need to copy GPG keys to remote systems


## Looking back, moving forward {#looking-back-moving-forward}

The evolution in my approach to [productivity](#productivity) and [habits](#habits) reflects a broader theme this
year - finding balance between structure and flexibility. Moving away from rigid tracking
towards more intuitive systems hasn't meant losing focus; rather, it allowed to naturally
integrate these habits into daily life.

My musical journey with **percussion** has added an entirely new dimension to my life, proving
that growth doesn't always have to be technical or career-focused. The rhythm and joy of
playing congas and bongos has become a welcome counterpoint to the digital world.

Looking ahead to 2025, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead - from deepening
my [Kubernetes](https://brainfck.org/t/kubernetes) knowledge to mastering new rhythms on the congas. But
perhaps more importantly, I'm grateful for the community of people who have been part of
this journey, sharing knowledge, experiences, and moments of joy along the way. As always,
these reviews serve not just as personal milestones, but as reminders of how we grow
through both the _challenges we face_ and the _opportunities we embrace_. Here's to another
year of learning, creating, and growing together.
