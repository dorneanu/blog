In my previous post I've writen about _knowledge work_ and how its output cannot be measured
in a linear manner. For knowledge workers **information** is their most valuable capital, yet
everyone is desperately looking for a system to manage the continous influx of information
pouring into their brains.

We spend a tremendous amount of time _managing_ huge amounts of information and _searching_
for the right piece of knowledge. At the same time we are supposed to work at high
standards (fast and continously) and keep up with emerging technologies.

## Commonplace books {#commonplace-books}

Dealing with different kinds of input (books, articles, mails, messages etc.) can be
exhausting and has a direct influence on your attention span. Individualized and
internalized workflows how to deal with content/information definitely leads to better
attention control, better productivity, release of cognitive resources.

Before we had information overload, the [commonplace book](https://brainfck.org/book/building-a-second-brain/#commonplace-books) a diary or a journal of personal
_reflections_. While it became popular in the _Industrial Revolution_ (18th/19th century) it was
mainly used by the educated class to understand "a rapidly changing world and their place in
society".

Nowadays the _digital_ version of the commonplace book is the [Second Brain](https://brainfck.org/book/building-a-second-brain/#commonplace-books).
{{% sidenote %}}
Other popular terms: Zettelkasten (slip box in German), memex, braindump or digital garden.
{{% /sidenote %}} It's a combination of a study notebook, personal journal, sketchbook, collection of
bookmarks etc. You can use it in different **contexts** (such as _work_, _personal_) and its main
purpose is to **organize** knowledge while allowing you to

-   make ideas concrete
-   reveal new associations between ideas
-   incubate ideas over time
-   sharpen unique perspectives
-   most important: **take** action


## P.A.R.A. method {#p-dot-a-dot-r-dot-a-dot-method}

Tiago has developed his own system how to organize information. Information is organized based on how _actionable_ it is and not on its _type_ or _kind_. That's why it's so universal and applicable for almost every profession or field.

[P.A.R.A.](https://brainfck.org/book/building-a-second-brain/#para) is more like a _production_ system. You won't be able to always find the _right_ place
where a note belongs to. The category you initially put a note to, might change depending
on your current projects and however your thoughts change in _life_. Every piece of
information can be put into one of following categories:

-   **Projects**
    -   current tasks you're actually working on (short-term efforts)
-   **Areas**
    -   Reponsibilities you want to manage over time (long-term efforts)
-   **Resources**
    -   Topics/Interests that might be useful in the future
    -   What topics are you interested in?
        -   Architecture; Interior design; English literature; Beer brewing.
    -   What subjects are you researching?
        -   Habit formation; Notetaking; Project management; Nutrition.
    -   What useful information do you want to be able to reference?
        -   Vacation itineraries; Life goals; Stock photos; Product testimonials.
    -   Hobbies
    -   Passions
-   **Archives**
    -   _Inactive_ items from the categories above


## Zettelkasten vs P.A.R.A. {#zettelkasten-vs-p-dot-a-dot-r-dot-a-dot}

I used to call my knowledge database
{{% sidenote %}}
Or PKMS (Personal Knowledge Management System)
{{% /sidenote %}} a Zettelkasten
{{% sidenote %}}
[Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) used one to write his many books. I can definitely recommend "[How to take notes](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes)" (SÃ¶hnke Ahrens) (german: [Das Zettelkasten-Prinzip](https://brainfck.org/book/das-zettelkasten-prinzip/)) for further reading.
{{% /sidenote %}} (engl. slip box). I think the _Zettelkasten_ approach appeals more with _creative writing_ since it allows you to interconnect ideas easily due to the flat hierarchy between notes. _Zettelkasten_ is a note-taking method designed to spark new ideas, whereas _P.A.R.A._ is a way of organizing files and content for a specific project.

Since the _Zettelkasten_ expects you to have links between your _zettels_, you should be able to "browse" your
thoughts/notes easily while looking for new ideas. This way the _Zettelkasten_ makes it easy to create new
content (articles, essays, books) and put together thoughts/concepts since you have already done the hard work of summarizing content and creating new links. _P.A.R.A._ instead is more for the lazy ones: It doesn't force you to summarize

you could reuse these in a different one (as an [intermediate packet](https://brainfck.org/book/building-a-second-brain/#intermediate-packets)).


## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Around 2019 I came across the [P.A.R.A. method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) as I was searching for a system how to organize highlights from different books. Later on I've read about [Zettelkasten](https://brainfck.org/book/das-zettelkasten-prinzip/) and implemented it using [TiddlyWiki](https://tw5.brainfck.org). This year I was quite excited when I first saw "[Building a Second Brain](https://brainfck.org/book/building-a-second-brain/#intermediate-packets)" on goodreads.

Overall I think it's an awesome resource for everyone starting in the PKMS world. _P.A.R.A._ is easy to apply, universal and applicable for every domain. After reading the book, I as well started to rethink my Tiddlywiki setup (which lead me to [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/)) and focus more on _projects_: I collect notes, ideas for a specific project and before I do the kick-off I make sure I have everything I need to start and also finish the project.
