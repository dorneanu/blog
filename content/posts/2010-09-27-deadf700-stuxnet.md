The whole world seems to be concerned about this new worm... I think it was Stuxnet. Meanwhile a (hex?) pattern is putting the cat among the pigeons. Its about **DEADF700**. What could this be? The word is that it is the last command Stuxnet is waiting for. The last command before what? Before the whole building explodes? Let's come back to one's senses.
