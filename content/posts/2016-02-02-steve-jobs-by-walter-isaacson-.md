![Steve Jobs](/posts/img/2016/d704a2159c59405830720a21211a90e6.jpg)

From time to time I like to read about great personalities and how their handling and decisions
changed the world. I'm not an Apple fan and I do have something against Apple's closed platform 
approach. I also don't obsessively admire Mr. Jobs and its products, but this book gives you a
very good impression how it feeled to work *with* and *for* Steve Jobs. Although this is the only
book I've read about him, I think Mr. Jobs had a really huge impact on what we define nowadays 
a *well designed product*. I also admire his intention to combine arts and technology and give
people the right tools to express their creativity. I highly recommend this book for those who 
want to learn more about **how this whole PC thing** started and why Microsoft and Xerox have missed
the chance to revolutionize the world.
