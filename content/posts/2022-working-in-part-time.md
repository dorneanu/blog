I've recently stumbled over this wired article [1] where the benefits and drawbacks of
having a 4-day work week were conclued from scientific research and "experiments" done in
the field.

Seems like there is a momentum recently as more companies (but also governments) around
the world explore the benefits of the 4-day work week:

Wherever part-time was allowed employees saw it as a mixed blessing: While others
considered it a "godsend" others found it rather stressful to do the same amount of work
within less time. But reducing work hours while having the same work-load on your plate
misses the point. Part-time is not only about work-life balance as perceived by the
majority:

For the same reason I've put together these lines because many friends and (ex-)colleagues
have reported some aversion towards part-time from their employers. I think employers
should stop seeing part-time as some exotic type of work. Instead they should embrace
flexible models and encourage their staff to work less and/or more efficiently.

Knowledge work (as the majority of us in the IT industry deals with) cannot be compared to
typical "industrial work" with regard to the hours we spend working: Knowledge workers do
not sit at the assembly lines and are expected to do X "amount of work" within a period of
time. This is not how the creative process of programming, setting up a new
infrastructure, come up with a new software design works like. Really "deep" work (a
concept introduced by Cal Newport [2]) is about tackling hard things and to produce at an
elite level, in terms of quality and speed.

So it's not only about the time you spend working, but also about the quality of work
you're delivering. As for the time factor I can definitely say that when you squeeze the
same amount of work into less time, work (seen as the quality of your results)
intensifies. Working less - I mean the amount of time you have available to get something
done - also means you cannot afford spending to much time in meetings, having X coffee
breaks etc. While I'm still convinced that the social benefits of fiddling around with
your colleagues, having lunch together, do some chit-chat are essential for a good work
environment (and for your own well-being), part-time forces me to allocate my time more
wisely.

While I work 4 days a week and compress lots of talks within less available time, I can
completely 𝘥𝘦𝘤𝘰𝘮𝘱𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘴 again for the remaining 3 days. This allows me to take care of my
mental health, exercise more, spend more time with family and recharge my batteries for
the next week. This is a win-win situation for both parties: I indeed have a work-life
balance which allows me to focus on the things that matter and prioritize my activies
effectively.

So part-time is not only about working less. It's more a commitment towards better
productivity, efficiency and self-care.
