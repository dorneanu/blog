Yepp.. It's another one. I've tested [it][1] on my own laptop and voila: BOOM! Anoher local root exploit is out there. In fact this exploit shouldn't have been released at all.. An earlier [incident][2] was reported in 2007.So why in God's sake is this malfunction still in the wild? We don't know it. I'd call it stupidity, if you're fine with me. L33t hackers like Ac1db1tch3z seem to have [antipathy][3] against good security researchers like Ben Hawkes. Nevertheless I was able to find a [workaround][3] which will fix the problem. Unfortunately this doesn't fix the problem at all:

~~~.shell
# echo ':32bits:M:0:x7fELFx01::/bin/echo:' > /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register
$ ./boom
resolved symbol commit_creds to 0xffffffff81068009
resolved symbol prepare_kernel_cred to 0xffffffff81067f0c
mapping at 3f80000000
UID 0, EUID:0 GID:0, EGID:0
# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) Gruppen=0(root)</pre>
~~~

So where is the solution?!Â  Check [this][4] and [this][5].
