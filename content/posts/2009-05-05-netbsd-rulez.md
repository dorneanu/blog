I just started installing NetBSD on my 2nd laptop. Everything works like a charm! (thanks L. for your support xD) I was kind of sick of Linux/Debian and wanted to try something new. I made my decision and installed NetBSD due to its high portability: "Of course it runs NetBSD!" I heard Thinkpads are very well supported by NetBSD but I need to accomodate to the new system and do some testings before installing it on my main working machine. I managed it to install the base system plus some extras like FluxBox and Firefox. Some last words for this article? `make install clean`
