This is what I've received yesterday from some phone number I don't really know. BTW: Which countrys prefix is that? The crazy thing about it: Every time I was sending a message to it, it responded with:

> Thank you. We have received your message.

I had a look at the video sent and it seems to belong to some local club here in town. I was receiving some SPAM SMS from them but this time it was sth new. And besides that: Is that a WhatsApp bot?! Does anybody have seen sth similar before?!
