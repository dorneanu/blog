Ever since I started highlighting text on my Kindle, then my PocketBook, and also the [old-fashioned way with pen and paper](/2021/06/13/note-taking-in-2021/), I have been trying to store those highlights in my [digital garden](https://brainfck.org) — which serves as a **second brain** for recalling insights from books I have read. I built [brainfck.org](https://brainfck.org) to keep my collection of notes available online, not only for myself but also for others. I even added a [search feature](https://brainfck.org/books/) (first introduced in [ce36502](https://github.com/dorneanu/roam/commit/ce365029a143dad9b8bdb11f8484c0a8ba97b017) and later improved in [9a23b40](https://github.com/dorneanu/roam/commit/9a23b40)) that lets you search across the entire collection. Whenever I want to look something up, I go to [brainfck.org](https://brainfck.org), type in a keyword, and it shows me the books and journal entries where that word appears.

Recently I built a workflow that allows to expand all this. I now have all my _e-books_ loaded into [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com) notebooks, organised year by year, so I can ask questions across everything I have read in a given period. The process is to convert EPUBs and
PDFs to Markdown, upload them into the relevant notebook, and start asking questions. A particularly useful feature is that you can select a single source and have a focused conversation about just that one book.

This post describes how I built it using Claude Code with the NotebookLM MCP server and the Dropbox (where I usually store my EPUB files).


## The goal {#the-goal}

The end state is simple: one NotebookLM notebook per year (Books 2020, Books 2021, …, Books 2026), each containing the
full text of every book I read that year. With that in place I can do things like:

> "What did these books say about motivation and focus?"
>
> "Summarise each book in three bullet points"
>
> "Which books overlap on the topic of climate change?"

## The tools {#the-tools}

I used three MCP servers inside Claude Code:

-   [notebooklm-mcp](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli) — create notebooks, add sources, query them
-   [DropboxMCP](https://mcp.dropbox.com) — search and download EPUBs/PDFs from my PocketBook library synced to Dropbox
-   **WebFetch** — scrape [brainfck.org/books](https://brainfck.org/books/) to get the canonical list of books per year

To keep MCP servers scoped per repository, add them to your project's `.claude.json` under `mcpServers`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notebooklm-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "notebooklm-mcp"
    },
    "DropboxMCP": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.dropbox.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Install the NotebookLM CLI once globally with:

```bash
uv tool install notebooklm-mcp-cli
```

The Dropbox MCP is a hosted HTTP server — no local install needed, just authenticate once via `claude mcp auth DropboxMCP` in the project directory.


## The workflow {#the-workflow}


### Step 1: Get the book list for a year {#step-1-get-the-book-list-for-a-year}

The [brainfck books page](https://brainfck.org/books) lists the books I have read, sorted by year. Starting with only two notebooks ("Books 2026" and "Books 2025"), I wanted to create notebooks for earlier years but I did not know which books I actually had as EPUBs in Dropbox.

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2026/building-personal-book-library-notebooklm/brainfck-books-page.png" title="brainfck.org/books" caption="The books page on brainfck.org — books grouped by year with read dates and tags. This served as the ground truth for which books belong in which notebook." pos="left" >}}

```mcp
WebFetch https://brainfck.org/books/
→ returns books grouped by year with their read dates
```
<div class="src-block-caption">
  <span class="src-block-number">Code Snippet 1:</span>
  Use claude-code to WebFetch the list of books
</div>

With the book list in hand, I also asked Claude to list the existing NotebookLM notebooks so I could see which years were already covered and how many sources each had:

The response is structured as a table — books by year, plus other notebooks I use for music and programming topics." pos="left" >}}


### Step 2: Search Dropbox for the files {#step-2-search-dropbox-for-the-files}

For each book I ran a parallel Dropbox search:

I asked Claude to search for each book title using the `DropboxMCP` MCP tool. Under the hood, Claude Code calls the tool directly:

```mcp
# Claude Code MCP tool call (one per book, all run in parallel)
mcp__DropboxMCP__search
  query: "Book Title"
  file_extensions: ["epub", "pdf"]
  filename_only: true
```

Claude ran all searches in parallel, then cross-referenced the results against the book list. Many books lived in year-based folders (`E-Books/2024/`, `E-Books/2025/`, etc.), while older ones were in the root `E-Books/` folder or the `Golang/` subfolder.


### Step 3: Extract text content {#step-3-extract-text-content}

For files under 5MB, the Dropbox MCP can extract text directly:

```mcp
mcp__DropboxMCP__get_file_content
  path_or_file_id: "id:aTF8BX-..."
```

For larger files (5–15MB EPUBs, oversized PDFs), I had to generate shared download link:

```mcp
mcp__DropboxMCP__create_shared_link
  path_or_file_id: "id:aTF8BX-..."
  allow_download: true
```

Then downloaded locally and converted with `pandoc`:

```bash
pandoc -t markdown book.epub -o book_full.md
```

For PDFs, `pdftotext` worked better:

```bash
pdftotext book.pdf book_full.md
```


### Step 4: Create the notebook and upload {#step-4-create-the-notebook-and-upload}

With the converted Markdown files in hand, I first created a new notebook for the year, then added each book as a source. The `notebook_create` call returns a notebook ID which is then passed to every subsequent `source_add` call:

```mcp
# 1. Create the notebook for the year (returns a notebook_id)
mcp__notebooklm-mcp__notebook_create title: "Books 2024"

# 2. For each book: upload the converted Markdown file as a source
mcp__notebooklm-mcp__source_add
  notebook_id: "..."          # ID returned from step 1
  source_type: file
  file_path: "/path/to/book_full.md"
  title: "The Effective Executive"
```

All `source_add` calls for a given year ran in parallel — typically 6–8 at once — so populating a full year's notebook took only a minute or two.


## Querying across years {#querying-across-years}

With all notebooks populated, I can now query a year's reading. But even simpler — I can just ask Claude Code in plain English:

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2026/building-personal-book-library-notebooklm/claude-code-querying-books-2026.png" title="Asking Claude Code about Books 2026" caption="A plain-English query to Claude Code: \"which books are in 2026?\" — Claude calls the notebooklm-mcp tool and returns a clean list of the 5 books in that notebook." pos="left" >}}

Or go deeper with a structured query:

```nil
mcp__notebooklm-mcp__notebook_query
  notebook_id: "Books 2026"
  query: "Give me a short summary of each book — main argument and key takeaways"
```

The answers are grounded in the source material and surprisingly detailed. Here's an example querying the main concepts from _Earth for All_:

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2026/building-personal-book-library-notebooklm/claude-code-earth-for-all-query.png" title="Querying Earth for All via Claude Code" caption="Asking Claude Code for the main concepts from \"Earth for All\" — it queries the notebooklm-mcp tool and returns a structured breakdown of the book's core premise, five turnarounds, and key ideas." pos="left" >}}

This is particularly useful for rediscovering insights from books I read years ago and for finding thematic threads across multiple books in the same period.

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2026/building-personal-book-library-notebooklm/notebooklm-books-2025-detail.png" title="Inside the Books 2025 notebook" caption="The Books 2025 notebook with 9 sources loaded. The Studio panel on the right offers audio overviews, slide decks, mind maps, and more — all generated from the book content." pos="left" >}}

The whole setup took a few hours across multiple sessions — most of that was handling edge
cases (DRM, oversized files, misplacements). The actual notebook creation and uploading
per year takes about 5 minutes once the files are in order.
