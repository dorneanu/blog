I've been coding Python for almost one week. I really thank O'Reilly for their good quality and well structured books. If you ever plan to learn Python, just have a look at "Learning Python - 3rd Edition" by Mark Lutz. You'll love it! And you'll really get impressed and fascinated by Pythons vast functionalities like I did.

So what's the big thing about Python? Well to be honest my answer is simply: Because it's damn cool. Ok, don't get me wrong, but once you started working with it, you'll ask yourself why the #!?% in the world you didn't do that earlier. When learning this script language, you'll have to watch out for its viperish effect: Once it gets you, it will never let you loose. Ok, let's get more serious.

Like already mentioned, I'm still a Python newbie. But there are some cool features worth to be mentioned:

*   OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): It can reduce your code and improve your projects usibility. It's all about code reuse and well structured modules. You'll get more maintable code.
*   Polymorphism: Since almost everything is an `object` (variables, functions, structures, classes etc.), you can e.g. use classes as structures (like C ones) by typing: myclass.variable_inside_class
*   Runs on many platforms: Linux, Windows, Max OSX, but also Java and .NET machines
*   Huge standard (comprehensive) library
*   GOOD DOCUMENTATION (!)
*   Automatic garbage collection
*   ...

So what are YOUR reasons? Why do YOU use Python? Just drop some comments..
