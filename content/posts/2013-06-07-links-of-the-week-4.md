1.  [How the Prime Meridian Changed the World][1]: Not technical stuff but worth reading.
2.  [OpenSSH keys and the drunken bishop][2]: Ever wondered about that visual fingerprint when generating SSH keys? Well this article brings some light on that. I've tried on my own and that's fun: <pre class="lang:default decode:true">$ ssh -o VisualHostKey=yes victor@cia.gov -p 1337
Host key fingerprint is xxxxx

1.  [The effects of computer programming on the brain][3]: I should be worried about that. Are *YOUÂ *addicted to programming? Just in case, let me know...
2.  <http://www.blackhatlibrary.net/Shellcodecs>: Useful collection.
3.  [Use Google Authenticator For Two-Factor SSH Authentication in Linux:][4] Add 2-factor authentication to your SSH linux server. 2-Factor auth seems to be quite trendy these days...
4.  [Call For Papers - Balkan Computer Congress 2013][5]: My favourite anecdote related to this one: `... and because we're from Eastern Europe we like break things and stuff.` (some SAP guy :-))
5.  [Emacs is dead][6]: Old but worth mentioning it. I've never used Emacs btw. I'm a VIM lover since my birth.
6.  [Letter To A Young Programmer Considering A Startup][7]: `*I regularly get emails from young people, usually those with an interest in programming, who are trying to make decisions about school and/or their professional futures. This post is for those young people.*`
