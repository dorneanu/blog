I'd like to announce the second main release of [icmpKNOCK][1]. I thought it was about time to release a new improved version. I've mainly focused on the actions mechanism and tried to implement some flexible way of defining actions, adding key pattern and setting payloads. Besides that I have managed it to install a [SVN service][2] in order to provide the latest development version of my current projects.

The [CHANGELOG][3] for this version isn't quite long. There are no `new` features that have been added to this release. In fact I was busy cleaning up messy code and looking for bugs. I hope you'll enjoy it and don't esitate to drop me a mail if bugs were found.
