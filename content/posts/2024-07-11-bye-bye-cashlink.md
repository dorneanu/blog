In the midst of the Corona pandemic back in 2021, I joined the team at [Cashlink](https://cashlink.de/en/), a company focused on **tokenization** and **digital securities**.

{{% /sidenote %}} With little understanding of these concepts, I embarked on this new journey as a _Senior Security Engineer_ within the TECH team. Promised a _greenfield_ environment, I stepped into the unknown, excited yet uncertain about what I was expected to to.

As I look back on almost three years of knowledge sharing at Cashlink, I realize just how much I've learned. Embracing one of Cashlink's core values, I consistently strived to _challenge the status quo_. Throughout this journey, I've gained a deep understanding of what DevSecOps truly is about, with a particular focus on the _operational side_.

Having said this, I'm looking forward to my newest challenge, where I'll switch focus to the _Dev_ part in DevSecOps and delve deeper into _software engineering_, but still within the Security context. I also anticipate doing more coding, particularly in _Golang_, which kind of makes me happy. I remain grateful for all that I've experienced and learned at Cashlink and hope to see you all soon again, whether in Frankfurt, Cluj, or Berlin!

## What I've learned {#what-i-ve-learned}

As I was implementing security in the greenfield area, I had the chance to strengthen my knowledge in specific areas but also deep-dive into new ones.

-   **AWS**
    -   One of the first things I wanted to introduce was **SSO** which mainly included configuration of the [AWS Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/identity-center/) with an _external_ Identity Provider (IdP). Later I was introducing **SSO for SSH** (using [AWS Session Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html)) which required employees to first do _authentication_ against the **IdP** before SSHing into machines.
    -   While I had no clue about [SAML based SSO](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6262987) later on I've also had the chance to implement several [OIDC based](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/oidc-conformant-authentication/oidc-adoption-sso) workflows
    -   Back at Scout24 I've barely had to deal with IaC (Infrastructure as Code) where **CDK** was mainly used. At Cashlink I've created my first [CDK applications](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) for different setups. While being an convinced CDK is the way to go, I later on had the chance to learn _Terraform_ which is my prefered IaC solution at the moment. Using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) I was able to quickly create PoCs and manage complex infrastructure setups

    -   Personally, setting up the networking infrastrcture (several [VPCs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html), with several [TGWs](https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/) in a [multi-account organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/organizing-your-aws-environment.html)) was the biggest challenge which taught me a lot about networking and what Network Security is about.
-   **IAM** (as a _concept_)

    -   Especially within _distributed systems_ proper and granular **access management** becomes of the most fundamental Security pillars
    -   _IAM_ (Identity &amp; Access Management), when done properly, definitly can reduce the _blast radius_ in case of a Security incident.
    -   Besides _OIDC_ and _SAML_ I definitely learned how to setup IAM concepts which include _authentication_ and _authorization_ for different entities (people and machines, generally speaking) within an organization. Later on, while setting up the **K8s** cluster I've learned about [IRSA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) based authentication.

    AWS lately introduced [EKS Pod Identities](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-identities.html).
    {{% /sidenote %}}
-   **K8s**
    -   Retrospectively, I wish I'd have started learning about the concepts way earlier. While I was learning by implementing stuff, I didn't have a proper introduction which also explained the underlying technologies. Only a few weeks ago, I've decided to take a more structured approach and purchased [Kubernetes in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/kubernetes-in-action) which I think is an excellent introduction with good practical examples.
    -   Nevertheless I was fortunate enough to have some close insights into [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), what it takes to _manage it_, how to deal with _secrets_ and _configurations_. As I already was mentioning in in the IAM section understanding [Kubernets RBAC system](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) and how one can map AWS IAM to it, took a while (right _Aron_? üòé)
    -   As I'm reading more all the concepts suddenly make sense and I can finally grasp better how all the pieces work together. I will definitely create my own cluster soon (most probably using [k3s](https://k3s.io/)) for having a playground where I can safely play with [helm charts](https://helm.sh/), deploy applications.
-   **Smart Contract Security**
    -   Smart contracts are at the heart of Cashlink's core business. Diving deep into smart contracts, especially using Solidity, was quite a challenge as a complete beginner.
    -   Understanding all the potential attacks related to these contracts proved to be a challenging task as long as you don't have to deal with it on a daily basis. I hope that someday I'll have the time and resources to set up a playground where I can experiment with these technologies and simulate various smart contract attacks.

-   **Mariano**
    -   You were right! Our first discussion back in Frankfurt was about working in _full-remote_ and the fact I still need a community / colleagues around me. You remembered that when we met in Cluj this year! I really enjoyed our discussoin around _nutrition_, _sports_ and life in general. Take care and see you end of August üòã

    -   Thanks for your patience and for the fact you were the one to teach me K8s! Let's keep in touch and conquer the world with Golang, Terraform and Kubernetes. I also wish you all the best with your climbing career üßó
-   **Maik**
    -   Let's go to _Aventura_, right? I guess we both won't forget that evening. I wish you all the best becoming a üáßüá¨ and let's do the _Moldova trip_ soon again.

    -   I'm glad I've convinced you to buy a [La Pavoni](https://www.lapavoni.com/en/families/domestic-machines/lever-coffee-machines). You definitely have reached nerd level 500 with all the [mods and customizations](https://coffee-sensor.com/product-category/la-pavoni-parts-and-accessories-custom-made-from-coffee-sensor/) üòé. I'm still looking forward meeting your home roaster.
