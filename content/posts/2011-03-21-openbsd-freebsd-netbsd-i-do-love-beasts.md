It all starts with virtualisation! Since there is no BSD at all on my laptop, I thought I should give the most important ones a chance: FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD. Although there were several rumours afloat &#8211; related to complexity factors (installation, configuration etc.) &#8211; I had absolutely no problem setting up *BSD with X11(!!!). Besides that I had a look at the packaging systems provided within each BSD. My conclusion: They are pretty much the same: **make install** and basta. Here some screenshots:<!--more-->
