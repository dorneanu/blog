1.  <a href="http://www.kwartzlab.ca/2013/05/first-glimpse-soul-tamagotchi/" target="_blank">First Glimpse into the Soul of Tamagotchi</a>: Remember my post about <a href="http://dornea.nu/blog/2012/12/29c3" target="_blank">29C3</a>? There I've first mentioned Natalie and her passion for Tamagotchis. She's doing some progress! Obvisouly! I really like the screenshots.
2.  [CVE-2013-2094][1]: This is definitely the **bug of the week**! Have a closer detailed look [here][2]. The exploit was ported to [x86][3].
3.  Interview with a BlackHat: [Part 1][4], [Part 2][5], [Part 3][6]
4.  <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2013/05/your-login-form-posts-to-https-but-you.html?m=1" target="_blank">Your login form posts to HTTPS, but you blew it when you loaded it over HTTP</a>: I can't believe this is still a issue. In 2013!
5.  <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/05/17/romanian_hacker_atm_security/" target="_blank">Jailed Romanian hacker repents, invents ATM security scheme</a>: I'd call that: Twist of fate!
6.  [10 reasons you should never get a job][7]: Don't get me wrong but this article is full of provocative ideas and preconceptions.
