There is certainly some frustration with **productivity tools** that feel more like a burden
than a boost. During my career I've tried different digital planners, time-blocking apps,
task managers, only to find myself overhelmed by their complexity and not really matching
my **personal workflow**. The truth is, the **tools** are **not** the problem: _it's how we use them_.
Instead of adopting new tools, one should first come up with a strategy/workflow that
respects the need for **focus** and **creativity**. Whether it's mapping out a week in a
**Frankenlog** or capturing spontaneous ideas in my (analogue) notebook, the goal is always
the same: To stay intentional (aka focused) and to not get lost in items/tasks.


## Multi-Scale planning {#multi-scale-planning}

Planning is not just about scheduling - it's about creating a framework to move through
time with clarity. I break down my goals into **three** layers: **Yearly, quaterly and weekly**.

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2025/digital-analogue-productivity/notebook-goals-2024.jpeg" title="Yearly goals" caption="Visual representation of yearly goals, outlining key objectives and milestones across diverse life areas such as work, family, sports, music, and me-time to ensure balanced long-term focus and direction" pos="left" >}}

ðŸ’¡ Fresh reminder what multi-scale planning is about (see [multi scale planning](https://brainfck.org/t/multi-scale-planning)):

> Concepts:
>
> -   Multiscale Time Planning
>     -   The concept involves planning at **multiple time scales**, including monthly/quarterly, weekly, and daily
>     -   This approach helps to increase the level of detail as you move from larger to smaller scales, which is essential for effective time management.
>
> -   Flexibility and Adaptability
>     -   A crucial principle of multiscale planning is the understanding that **plans are not static**
>     -   They should be **flexible and adaptable** to changes
>     -   Adjusting plans as needed is expected, not a deviation from the strategy.
>     -   You don't get extra points for sticking to the plan
>
> -   Monthly/Quarterly Planning
>     -   This scale is vital for avoiding **deadline-driven** chaos
>     -   It allows for advanced preparation and scheduling to **meet major deadlines** and handle significant tasks efficiently.
>     -   It involves breaking down tasks week by week and maintaining a freestyle format for each week's notes, focusing on the big picture and major upcoming events or deadlines.
>
> -   Weekly and Daily Planning
>     -   These scales involve more detailed planning
>     -   Weekly plans describe scheduled **commitments and tasks for each day of the week**
>     -   Daily planning is the most detailed, assigning specific tasks to each hour of the day, thus providing control over daily activities

I rely on digital tools like text files, Github issues, Jira tickets, calenders to track
**deadlines** and **milestones**. But for the **daily rhythm**, analogue methods are just better
suited. My notebook becomes my **anchor**, where I capture thoughts, notes (from meetings),
reflect on progress and let ideas flow freely (e.g. sketching the IT architecture for a
new service). This dual approach ensures I'm not lost in the noise of **digital overload**,
while still maintaining a sense of direction.


## The Frankenlog {#the-frankenlog}

The [Frankenlog](https://frankenlog.com/) iy my go-to system for **visualizing** my week. My approach to **weekly planning**
is a **hybrid** of analog and digital: A paper calendar where I sketch out **time blocks** for
_work_, _rest_ and _creative projects_, paired with a **digital** version which includes
appointments (personal _and_ work related), reminders. For me it serves like a balance
between _structure_ and _flexibility_ because I like to know what needs to be done that week.

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2025/digital-analogue-productivity/notebook-frankenlog-weekly.jpeg" title="Frankenlog" caption="Frankenlog: A hybrid weekly planning system blending analog and digital tools. The paper calendar visualizes time blocks for /work/, /rest/, and /creative projects/, offering flexibility and tactile engagement. Paired with a digital version for appointments, reminders, and real-time updates, it balances structure with adaptability. This dual approach ensures clarity on weekly priorities while allowing adjustments for unexpected tasks." pos="left" >}}

As for the digital side of things: The image below displays a structured **Org mode** file in Emacs, organized into hierarchical headings for multi-scale planning:

-   **2025** (yearly)
    -   **2025-Q1** (quarterly)
        -   **wk01**, **wk02**, **wk03** (weekly)
    -   **2025-Q2** (quarterly)
        -   **wk20**, **wk21** (weekly)

This layout integrates **work-related** and **personal** goals, enabling layered planning across
yearly, quarterly, and weekly scales. The structure reflects a hybrid digital-analog
workflow, with Emacs serving as a central hub for organizing tasks, deadlines, and
reflectionsâ€”supporting both professional and personal productivity.

The Frankenlog helps me track weekly goals, but I also need a clear view of **daily tasks**.
In Emacs, the _org-super-agenda_ view organizes my TODOs by project and priority, showing
both overarching workweek goals and specific tasks for each project. This keeps me focused
on what matters most without getting lost in details.

This view shows both general workweek tasks and detailed project goals, helping to balance big-picture planning with actionable steps." pos="left" >}}


## Time blocking {#time-blocking}

Time blocking is **not** about filing every minute with TODOs and use every single possible
time gap to do something "_productive_" (for me this is **busyness** where people suffer from
way to ambitious timelines and poorly managed workloads). For me it's more about managing
my available time but also my **mental capacity** to do **cognitively** demanding tasks. Therefore
I prioritize **deep work**, **rest**, **sports** but also some recreational time where I can take a
break from everything and let my mind just relax (see [Stolen Focus](https://brainfck.org/book/stolen-focus)
why this is important).

My goal is to create **capacity** rather than **load**. For instance, I migh block off a 90-minute
slot for **deep work** but afterwards I make sure my brain gets enough time to recover from
that intense session. I might then go for a walk, cook or play an instrument. While time
blocking visually shows how I plan my day, it's definitely not _static_. Some important
meetings might fly in so the whole day schedule has to be rearranged.

This approach prioritizes mental capacity over rigid schedules, allowing flexibility to adapt to unexpected tasks while maintaining focus on high-impact activities. The boxes symbolize intentional time allocations, balancing structured productivity with recovery, in line with Cal Newportâ€™s emphasis on deep work and mindful time management." pos="left" >}}


## The power of handwriting {#the-power-of-handwriting}

There are still many reaons why people didn't abandon **handwriting** completely. There is
some sort of magic in writing by hand that digital notes can't replicate. My analogue
_notebook_ is my primaray tool for capturing ideas, tasks and reflections. I use it to
brainstorm future blog posts (like this one ðŸ˜Ž), list TODOs for projects (e.g. "gardening
tasks" or "balcony redesign") and even sketch out quick visual ideas. It's also part of my
daily routine where I take 10 minutes to visually plan and block my day, revisit my
quarterly/weekly goals and think about what else I need to accomplish on that day.

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2025/digital-analogue-productivity/notebook-blog-posts.jpeg" title="Collection of planned blog posts" caption="Collection of planned blog posts and ideas captured in the notebook, showcasing how handwriting fosters creativity and intentionality. Used for brainstorming future content, listing project tasks (e.g., 'gardening tasks' or 'balcony redesign'), and sketching visual concepts. The tactile engagement of writing by hand enhances focus and allows ideas to flow freely without digital interruptions, serving as a foundational tool for reflection and planning in a hybrid workflow." pos="left" >}}

The act of writing not only forces me to **slow down** but it also gives me enough room for
creativity flows **without interruption**. Opening my laptop always felt for me like a
disruption especially because you have to log in, find your notetaking tool, type in etc.
In contrast, when I write by hand I'm fully engaged (aka focused!) with the moment. My
notebook becomes like a tactile extension of my mind, where ideas feel more real and
actionable. That said, I'm not **anti-digital**! I still don't want to miss it for scheduling,
searching through hundreds of files or for backing up my notes. As always, key is balance:
Let analog tools handle the creative and reflective work, use digital tools for further
enhancing that workflow.

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2025/digital-analogue-productivity/digital-emacs-para.png" title="Emacs for PARA" caption="A digital repository in Emacs Org mode, organized using a PARA-inspired structure (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives). The file PARA.org collects web articles, notes, and ideas categorized under Areas (e.g., Blog, Consultancy, Health) and Resource (e.g., AI, Architecture, Golang), serving as a dynamic knowledge base for future projects or reference. This system bridges digital organization with analog creativity, ensuring actionable insights are both structured and accessible." pos="left" >}}

My notebook is where I brainstorm and reflect, but I also use digital tools to
organize these ideas. For example, my _PARA.org_
([Building a Second Brain - PARA Method](https://brainfck.org/book/building-a-second-brain#para))
file in Emacs acts as a place to collect web articles, notes, and ideas. Itâ€™s
organized under _Areas_ (like Blog, Consultancy, Health) and _Resources_ (like AI,
Architecture, Golang). This helps me keep track of information I might need
later, blending creative thinking with structured planning.


## Conclusion {#conclusion}

The beauty of this approach is that it respects both my need for _structure_ and my _creative_
freedom. I've also learned that productivity isn't about completely eliminating
distractions - it's more about creating systems that support my unique rhythm and flow.
Whether it's a Frankenlog for weekly planning or a notebook for spontaneous ideas, my goal
is to stay _intentional_ about my goals without being lost in TODO items.
