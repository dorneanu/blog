## Summary {#summary}

{{< figure src="/posts/img/2022/building-microservices-2nd-edition/microservices-book-cover.jpg" caption="<span class=\"figure-number\">Figure 1: </span>\"Building Microservices (2nd edition)\" along my notes" >}}

During my overall IT carreer I came across different architectural design
patterns where oppinions differ on the question if they're the right ones for
the problems/challanges teams are dealing with. Before reading this book I was
familiar with _some_ of the microservices concepts but it was some article (on
modern architectures) that rouse my attention and introduced me to Sam Newman.
{{% sidenote %}}
I was reading the (German) [iX Magazin](https://www.heise.de/ix/) about [modern architectures](https://www.heise.de/news/Neues-iX-Developer-Sonderheft-Moderne-Softwarearchitektur-am-Kiosk-erhaeltlich-4874200.html).
{{% /sidenote %}} At the same time I was surprised to read about the similarities between
[Hexagonal Architecture](https://brainfck.org/#Hexagonal%20Architecture) and _microservices_. But
also topics like [DDD](https://brainfck.org/#DDD), [CD](https://brainfck.org/#Continuous%20Delivery%20(CD)),
[CI](https://brainfck.org/#Continuous%20Integration%20(CI)) are bound together in way that you need
to take a hollistic approach to (building) microservices.

I recommend this book
{{% sidenote %}}
Along with Martin Fowlers extensive arcticles on [microservices](https://martinfowler.com/microservices/).
{{% /sidenote %}} to anyone willing to spend some time (book has ca. 500 pages) learning about
[Information hiding](https://brainfck.org/#Information%20hiding), [communication between microservices](#ch-dot-4-communication-styles), [proper teams setup](#stream-aligned-teams), role of (IT) [architects](#ch-dot-16-the-evolutionary-architect) and much more. Fair enough the author
emphasizes multiple time the _complexity_ of decoupling existing services (monoliths) into
smaller, independent ones (microservices). The book recommendations in each chapter also
give a great hint where you can enlarge upon a specific topic.

What follows next is an [ORG mode](https://orgmode.org/) / outline style collection of notes, thoughts and quotes
from the book.


## Ch. 1: What are Microservices? {#ch-dot-1-what-are-microservices}


### Definition {#definition}

> [Microservices](https://brainfck.org/#Microservices) are independently releasable services that are modeled around a business
> domain. A service encapsulates functionality and makes it accessible to other services via
> networks.

-   [Microservices](https://brainfck.org/#Microservices) are a type of [SOA](https://brainfck.org/#SOA) architecture
    -   service boundaries are important
    -   independent deployability is key
-   [Microservices](https://brainfck.org/#Microservices) embrace the concept of [Information hiding](https://brainfck.org/#Information%20hiding)
{{% sidenote %}}
Introduced by David Parnas in _Information Distribution Aspects of Design Methodology_
{{% /sidenote %}}


### Key Concepts {#key-concepts}

-   **Independent deployability**
    -   criteria for this: make sure microservices are [loosely coupled](#coupling)
        -   be able to change one service without having to change anything else
-   **Modeled around a business domain**
    -   definition of service boundaries (see [DDD](#ddd))
-   **Owning their own state**
    -   hide internal state (same as encapsulation in [OOP](https://brainfck.org/#OOP))
    -   clean delineation between internal implementation details and external contract
        -   be backward-compatible
    -   hide database that backs the service
        -   avoid DB showing
-   **Size**

    > "A microservice should be as big as my head" - James Lewis

    -   keep it to the size at which it can be easily understood
-   **Flexibility**

    > "Microservices buy you options" - James Lewis

    -   they have a cost and you must decide whether the cost is worth the options you want
        to take up
-   **Alignment of architecture and organization**

    > "Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies
    > of the communication structures of the organization" - Melvin Conway

    -   have team vertically organized
        -   same team owns front-end, business logic, data, back-end, security
            -   a so called stream-aligned team


### Advantages {#advantages}

-   **Technology Heterogeneity**

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2022/building-microservices-2nd-edition/microservices_07-02-2022_12.35_4.jpg" title="Technology heterogenity" caption="You can use different technologies/programming languages for building multiple microservices." pos="left" >}}

-   **Robustness**
    -   a component in a system can fail but as long as the problem doesn't cascade, the rest
        of the system still works
-   **Scaling**
{{% sidenote %}}
    Book recommendation: [The art of scalability](https://www.goodreads.com/de/book/show/7282390-the-art-of-scalability)
    {{% /sidenote %}}
-   **Ease of Deployment**
    -   fast delivery of features
    -   decreases fear of deployment (see Accelerate)
    -   change a single service and deploy it independently of the system
-   **Organizational alignment**
    -   small teams working on small code bases tend to be more productive
    -   microservices allow us to better align our architecture to our organization
        -   minimize the number of people working in the team
            -   helps to find the sweet spot of team size and productivity
-   **Composability**
    -   reusable components
    -   allow functionality to be consumed in different ways
        -   for different purposes: website, desktop, mobile application etc.


### Pain Points {#pain-points}

-   **Developer Experience**
    -   new technologies are options not requirements
    -   when adopting microservices
        -   you'll have to understand issues around data consistency, latency, service modeling
        -   and how these ideas change the way you think about software development
        -   it takes time to understand new concepts
            -   this leads to less time developing new features
-   **Technology overload**
-   **Costs**
-   **Reporting**
    -   data and logs are scattered across multiple components
-   **Monitoring and troubleshooting**

-   **Latency**
-   **Data consistency**


## Ch. 2: How to model microservices {#ch-dot-2-how-to-model-microservices}


### [Information hiding](https://brainfck.org/#Information%20hiding) {#information-hiding}

-   hide as many details as possible behind a module / microservice boundary
-   Parnas identified following benefits:
    -   improved development time
    -   comprehensibility
        -   each module is isolated and therefore better to understand
    -   flexibility


### Cohesion {#cohesion}

-   code that changes together, stays together
-   strong cohesion
    -   ensure related behavior is at one place
-   weak cohesion
    -   related functionality is spread across the system


### Coupling {#coupling}

-   loosely coupled
    -   change to one service should not require a change to another
-   a loosely coupled services knows as little as it needs about the services it communicates with
    -   limitation of number of different types of calls is important


### Interplay of coupling and cohesion {#interplay-of-coupling-and-cohesion}

> A structure is stable if cohesion is strong and coupling is low.

-   cohesion applies to the relationship between things **inside** a boundary
-   coupling describes relationship **between things across** a boundary
-   still: there is no best way how to organize code


### [Types of coupling](https://brainfck.org/#Types%20of%20coupling) {#types-of-coupling}


#### Domain coupling {#domain-coupling}

-   one microservice interacts with another microservice because it needs the functionality
    the other microservice provides

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2022/building-microservices-2nd-edition/microservices_07-02-2022_12.35_5.jpg" title="Domain coupling" caption="Each microservice has a different functionality" pos="left" >}}

-   considered as a _loose_ form of coupling
-   again, information hiding: Share only what you absolutely have to, and send only the
    absolute minimum amount of data that you need


#### Pass-through coupling {#pass-through-coupling}

-   one microservice passes data to some other microservice because data is needed by another microservice

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2022/building-microservices-2nd-edition/microservices_07-02-2022_12.35_6.jpg" title="Pass-through coupling" caption="Some information is passed from one microservice to another" pos="left" >}}


#### Common coupling {#common-coupling}

-   when 1 or 2 microservices make use of a **common** set of data
    -   use of shared DB
    -   use of shared memory/filesystem
-   problem: changes to data can impact multiple microservices at once
-   better solution would be to implement [CRUD](https://brainfck.org/#CRUD) operations and let only 1
    microservice handle shared DB operations


#### Content coupling {#content-coupling}

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2022/building-microservices-2nd-edition/microservices_07-02-2022_12.35_7.jpg" title="Content coupling" caption="" pos="left" >}}

-   when an upstream service reaches into internals of a downstream service anc changes its
    internal state


### DDD {#ddd}

[DDD](https://brainfck.org/#DDD) stands for Domain-Driven Design.


#### Concepts {#concepts}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Ubiquitous language

    -   use the same terms in code as the user use
    -   have **common** language between delivery team and actual people (aka customers)
        -   helps to understand business by logic
        -   helps with communication
    -   use real-world language in code

<!--list-separator-->

-  Aggregates

    -   a **representation** of real domain concept
        -   something like an `Order`, an `Invoice`, `Stock Item`
    -   aggregates typically have an information cycle around them
    -   in general
        -   aggregate as something that has

            -   state
            -   identity
            -   information cycle

            that will be managed as part of the system
    -   aggregates can have **relationships** to other aggregates

        {{< gbox src="/posts/img/2022/building-microservices-2nd-edition/microservices_07-02-2022_12.35_8.jpg" title="Relationship between aggregates" caption="If relationships exist inside scope of the same microservices, we could use foreign keys to store relationship" pos="left" >}}

<!--list-separator-->

-  Bounded context

    -   a larger organizational boundary
        -   within it explicit responsibilities need to be carried out
    -   bounded contexts hide implementation details ([Information hiding](https://brainfck.org/#Information%20hiding))
    -   bounded contexts contain `1-n` aggregates
        -   some aggregates may be exposed outside the bounded context
        -   others may be hidden internally


#### Event Storming {#event-storming}

-   collaborative brainstorming exercise designed to help design a domain model
-   invented by [Alberto Brandolini](https://www.eventstorming.com/)


#### Boundaries between microservices {#boundaries-between-microservices}

There are some factors when defining clear boundaries between microservice

-   **volatility**
-   **data**
    -   also with concern to security
-   **technology**
-   **organizational**
    -   Layering Inside vs Layering Outside


## Ch. 3: Split the monolith {#ch-dot-3-split-the-monolith}

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2022/building-microservices-2nd-edition/microservices_07-02-2022_12.35_2.jpg" title="Monolith types" caption="Types of monoliths" pos="left" >}}

{{< gbox src="/posts/img/2022/building-microservices-2nd-edition/microservices_07-02-2022_12.35_3.jpg" title="Monolith types" caption="Distributed monolith: A system that consists of multiple services but for whatever reason the entire system must be deployed together. " pos="left" >}}

-   you need to have a **goal** before moving to microservices
    -   should be a conscious decision
    -   without clear understanding of what you want to achieve, you could fall into the trap of **confusing activity with outcome**

        > Spinning up a few more copies of your existing monolith system behind a load balancer may well help you scale your system
        > much more efficiently than going through a complex and length decomposition to microservices.
