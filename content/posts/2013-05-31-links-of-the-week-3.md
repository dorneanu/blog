1.  [Anatomy of a hack: How crackers ransack passwords like qeadzcwrsfxv1331 ][1]This is definetely **link of the month**! I never had to crack hashes in my life but this article is way the best introduction to the cracking/brute-forcing techniques. This is a must for all crackers out there (Thanks Marcin for the link).
2.  [Yes, disassemble with Javap ALL OVER THE PLACE! Hacking Java Bytecode for Programmers (Part3):][2] If the site is down check out this [link][3]. This guy diassembles java class files and analyzes opcodes. That's fucking cool! This is also a good introduction to bytecode analysis.
3.  [Four steps to Google, without a Degree:][4] After his [ABC: Always Be Coding - How to Land an Engineering Job][5] David Byttow gives you a somehow interesting view how you could apply to job at Google. If everything would be that easy...
4.  [Introduction to Buffer Overflows:][6] I know what you might think..`C'mon.. I've seen thousands of tutorials/papers like that.` You *mightÂ *be right but you also *might *miss one of the most comprehensive and visually (!) introduction to buffer overflows. BTW: `Your mother is so fat, the recursive function computing her mass causes a stack overflow.` <- You gotta love this one! 
5.  [The Shortest Crashing C Program][7]: A lot of people have to much free time.
6.  [Improving the security of your SSH private key files:][8] Well this article made me think about some things... Let me summarize that in one sentence: *1 Iteration for hashing using MD5 is way to insecure*! Switch to [PKCS#8][9] *now*!
