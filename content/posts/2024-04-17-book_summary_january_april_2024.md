Inspired by Eli Bendersky's [book reviews](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/tag/book-reviews), here are my summaries for the books I've read
between **January and April 2024**.

1.  📚 [Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don't Know by Adam Grant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55539565-think-again)

    I've received this book shortly after reading [ The Scout Mindset](https://brainfck.org/book/the-scout-mindset) where I learned about the _soldier_ vs _scout_ mindset where the later one can be
    shortly described in one quote:

    > “Your strength as a scout is in your ability… to think in shades of gray instead of black and white.”

    _Think again_ is more about different types of thinking (the preacher, the prosecutor,
    the politian and the scientist) and their main characteristics. I also learned that a
    debate is more like a [dance](https://brainfck.org/book/think-again/#part-2-interpersonal-rethinking) where the choreography between the partners has not been
    negotiated yet. Each one has his own steps in mind but professional debators know how
    to "end up in rhythm" with their partners. Adam Grant also gives [concrete advice](https://brainfck.org/book/think-again/#actions-for-impact) how to
    learn to develop the habit of thinking again and revising your own beliefs.

2.  📚 [The Startup CTO's Handbook: Essential skills and best practices for high performing engineering teams by Zach Goldberg](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/200314620-the-startup-cto-s-handbook)

    This is a comprehensive guide for CTOs and technical leaders in startup companies. It
    covers a wide range of essential topics for these people including technical
    leadership, team building, technology choices, infrastructure, technical debt. It also
    gives advice how to master the startup growth, have a fast hiring process, how to
    retain talent and how to scale technology infrastructure to meet increasing demands.

    Although I didn't know what to expect, for my taste it was too high-level.
    However, I liked the chapter about the _technical debt_ and its seven types. I
    also first learned about DX (Developer Experience) which refers to tools &amp;
    processes to make it easy to "have highly reliable and reproducible
    environments and dependency chains".

3.  📚 [Company Of One: Why Staying Small Is the Next Big Thing for Business by Paul Jarvis](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/37570605)

    I remember [Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/) once mentioned this book in one of [his episodes](https://calnewport.com/podcasts/) (this
    is how I got to read this book). In "Company of One," the capitalistic credo
    of (continuous) growth is questioned. Instead, "companies of one" should
    intentionally stay small. The main focus here is not the competitor's growth
    but rather focusing on customer relationships and their own success.
    According to Paul Jarvis, if you're focusing on growth, growth will happen.
    If you, however, want long-term customers and sales, you should focus on your
    few customers and their needs. There is absolutely no need for infinite
    growth just for the sake of getting bigger.

4.  📚 [The Minimalist Entrepreneur: How Great Founders Do More with Less by Sahil Lavingia](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/56913172)

    If you know [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/) then you probably also know about [Sahil Lavingia](https://sahillavingia.com/) who got by this
    [essay](https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting). Compared to the previous books on entrepreneurship, this focused more on the
    community for which you want to build products. Sahil emphasized the crucial part of
    identifying your ideal customers and building solutions for their needs. Once you figured
    out your potential customers, it's time to find out if they're willing to pay for your
    solutions:

    > "A business is a way to solve problems for people your care about - and get paid for it."

    The author also suggests you first become a creator and then an entrepreneuer. This way
    you should make sure your creativity is unleashed in order to create the best solutions
    for your business.

5.  📚 [Lost Connections: Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression - and the Unexpected Solutions by Johann Hari](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34921573-lost-connections)

    After having heard a lot about depression, its chemical root causes, the
    effects on humans in Andrew Huberman's [podcast](https://www.hubermanlab.com/) I was more than determined to
    read this book. Himself having to deal with depression, Johann Hari takes a
    journey to find out more about the mental illness that caused him to take
    pills (a la Prozac) and soon to find out they weren't a long-term solution.
    What if depression was not solely caused by some "imbalance of serotonin" in
    your brain? What if depression was merely a mix of environmental factors,
    childhood traumata, and predisposition (genes) to some behavioral patterns?

    Hari comes up with 9 causes for depression: _Disconnection_ from 1) meaningful work, 2)
    from other people, 3) from meaningful values, 4) childhood traume, 5) from status and
    respect, 6) from the natural world, 7) from a hopeful and secure future and finally 9)
    role of genes and brain changes. To quote the author, we all need to _reconnect_ again:

    > You aren’t a machine with broken parts. You are an animal whose needs are not being
    > met. You need to have a community. You need to have meaningful values, not the junk
    > values you’ve been pumped full of all your life, telling you happiness comes through
    > money and buying objects. You need to have meaningful work. You need the natural
    > world. You need to feel you are respected. You need a secure future. You need
    > connections to all these things. You need to release any shame you might feel for
    > having been mistreated.

6.  📚 [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/23692271)

    During the pandemic, a friend of mine recommended Harari to me and last year I
    read [ 21 Lessons for the 21st Century](https://brainfck.org/book/21-lessons-for-the-21st-century) by the same author. His thoughts immediately resonated with me so I
    (chronologically backwards) started to read his other masterpieces.

    From time to time, there has been some criticism about Harari and his criticism
    of today's humankind. Nevertheless, I think the book is an excellent journey of
    how `homo sapiens` managed to dominate the world, organize in groups, come up with
    financial, economic, and political systems. For me, it has been an extraordinary
    time travel which made me understand our world's mechanics.

7.  📚 [Stolen Focus: Why You Can't Pay Attention - and How to Think Deeply Again by Johann Hari](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/57933306)

    Ever since I've read about the [Attention Economy](https://brainfck.org/t/attention-economy)
    (first in [Digital Minimalism](https://brainfck.org/book/digital-minimalism)) I knew there is a
    whole (social media) industry whose main purpose is to monetize **our** time
    spent on their platforms. The more time we spend, the more ads can be shown,
    the more money can be generated.

    But this is just one reason we cannot **focus** anymore. Among the increased amount
    of information our brain has to deal with every day, technology that uses
    insights from behavioral psychology to capture your attention, the collapse of
    sustained reading (books!) the Hari makes an interesting point:

    > So we aren’t just facing a crisis of lost spotlight focus – we are facing a crisis of lost mind-wandering.

    Not only have we lost our ability to focus for a longer period of time, but
    we also no longer allow our minds to wander, which is crucial.

    > [...] rapidly switching between tasks, and I realised that in our current
    > culture, most of the time we’re not focusing, but we’re not mind-wandering
    > either. We’re constantly skimming, in an unsatisfying whirr.
