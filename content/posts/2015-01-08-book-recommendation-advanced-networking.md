During the past months I was from time to time reading all kind of stuff related to networking and security. During this process I came accross this book:

I found this book to be very comprehensive and very modern in sense of current topics
across the "network universe". If you ever wanted to get a more deep insight in how
routers communicate with each other or how to setup a VoIP infrastructure, this book 
is a must. Not only it provides very useful information to specific topics but it also
shows how to configure stuff using *Cisco* and *Juniper* hardware. At the end of each 
topic you'll get a short summary and a list of questions aimed at helping you to 
understand and internalize the material.

All in one a really good (e-)book on advanced networking, accompanied by good explanations
and visualizations.
