What should I say about this book? A lot has been said and this uppon reasonable grounds. This book is meant to give
you an overview of the most important security topics related to Android. Not only you'll
get a lot of stuff about Android's internals, you'll also learn about exploits (and how they work)
targeting the this platform. I think I didn't have the time (and also the full knowledge) to look
at any specific detail this book covers. There is so much this book has to offer. I wish I had more time
to fully understand the exploits and get more into hardware hacking - a topic which is still very alien 
to me. So if you intend becoming an Android hacker this, go buy this one. It's definitely worth the money!
