Keeping with the theme I've started a few months ago, here are my own book
summaries for the books I've read between _May_ and _September_ this year.

### 📚 Lost Connections {#lost-connections}

👉 [Lost Connections - Uncovering the Real Causes of Depression and the
  Unexpected Solutions by Johann Hari](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34921573-lost-connections)

After reading [The Lonely Century](https://brainfck.org/book/the-lonely-century) last year, which
opened my eyes to the increasing _isolation_ in our lives, I was kind of motivated
to read more on that topic. That's how I've found out about
[Lost Connections](https://brainfck.org/book/lost-connections) which is an exploration of _depression_
and its root causes.

The book introduces the concept of "_disconnection_" as a primary cause of depression. Hari
outlines seven types of disconnection. He talks about disconnection from _meaningful work_,
_other people_, _meaningful values_, _childhood trauma_, _status and respect_, the _natural world_
and from a _hopeful or secure future_.

What I found particularly insightful was Hari's exploration of ways to "_reconnect_." These
strategies offer paths to a more meaningful and enjoyable life, emphasizing our
connections to others and reminding us that "_humans are nature_" already. This perspective
adds a new dimension to my understanding of focus and attention, placing them within a
broader context of human well-being and social connection.

### 📚 Stolen Focus {#stolen-focus}

👉 [Stolen Focus - Why You Can't Pay Attention - and How to Think Deeply Again by Johann Hari](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57933306-stolen-focus)

After the impactful experience of reading [Lost Connections](https://brainfck.org/book/lost-connections) I felt compelled to delve into another of Hari's works. While "Lost
Connections" explored _depression_ and our daily _micro-interactions_ with people
and nature, "**Stolen Focus**" takes a more scientific, empirical approach to
investigating various aspects of _attention_.

One concept that immediately struck me was **James Willson**'s layered _model of attention_:

1.  **Spotlight** attention (first layer):
    -   Focuses on immediate actions like making coffee or reading a chapter.
    -   Involves narrowing down focus.
    -   Distraction at this level disrupts near-term actions.

2.  **Starlight** attention (second layer):
    -   Concentrates on longer-term goals such as writing a book or being a good parent.
    -   Acts as a guide when feeling lost, much like stars in the sky.
    -   Distraction here can cause us to lose sight of our longer-term objectives.

3.  **Daylight** attention (third layer):
    -   Enables understanding of our longer-term goals.
    -   Requires clear thinking and reflection.
    -   Compared to daylight illuminating a scene clearly.
    -   Distraction at this level can lead to losing our sense of personal identity and direction.

As I continued reading, I was amazed by Hari's comprehensive approach to the **attention
crisis**. He doesn't just point to the usual suspects like increasing _screen time_ and _social
media usage_. Instead, he adds a more nuanced picture of our changing relationship with
information and mental states. Therefore here are some aspects which lead to the deterioration
of our ability to focus and pay attention:

1.  The decline of book reading
    -   Having learned about the benefits of reading from [Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/), I found Hari's
        exploration of how people are giving up on books particularly resonant. It's not just
        about reading (like you do for entertainment reasons), but about the _cognitive
        benefits_ that extended, focused reading provides.

2.  The loss of mind-wandering
    -   This was an eye-opening concept for me which I've first met when Cal
        Newport was talking about the power of _solitude_ in his book
        [Digital Minimalism](https://brainfck.org/book/digital-minimalism). Hari argues that we're not
        only losing our ability to focus but also our capacity for _unstructured
        thought_ (aka mind-wandering, just do nothing). In our constant desire to
        stay "productive" or entertained, we've eliminated those crucial moments of
        mental downtime.

3.  The state of constant skimming
    -   Perhaps most alarmingly, Hari suggests that we're often neither focusing nor
        mind-wandering, but exist in a state of _constant skimming_. We're processing a
        never-ending _influx of information_ without truly processing it or allowing our minds
        to rest and reflect.

These insights have made me reconsider not just how I manage my attention, but
how I conceptualize it. It's clear that reclaiming our focus isn't just about
reducing screen time or blocking distractions – it's about fundamentally
restructuring how we engage with information and allow our minds to work.

## History and Anthropology {#history-and-anthropology}


### 📚 Sapiens {#sapiens}

👉 [Sapiens - A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens)

After becoming a Harari fan through "21 Lessons for the 21st Century" I was eager to dive
into "**Sapiens**". I consumed both books as audiobooks, each one quite long. While the audio
format was convenient, I found myself wishing for a physical or e-book copy to take notes.
The depth and breadth of Harari's books make me think I'll likely revisit these books in
the future for a more in-depth study.

In a nutshell "Sapiens" is about how **Homo sapiens** came to dominate the planet. Harari
talks about the story of our species' rise, from _outcompeting other human species_ (like
Neanderthals) to our impact on the animal kingdom, including the _extinction of many
species_ through hunting. This narrative is a very interesting look at our species'
historical impact on the planet.

Despite some criticism (I've had some serious discussions with my mother, who strongly
dislikes Harari), I believe the author does an excellent job explaining the _evolution of
fundamental human developments_ like writing and reading. He delves into the motivations
behind these advancements, providing insights into why and how they occurred.

What I particularly appreciate about "Sapiens" is its _interdisciplinary approach_ (I guess
this applies to all of his books). Harari touches on various aspects of human development,
including _religion_, _economy_, _sociology_, and _politics_. This comprehensive view offers
readers a deeper understanding of the society we currently live in, explaining the origins
of our laws and different political systems.

A _key takeaway_ from the book, which resonates with thoughts I've encountered in other
sources, is Harari's explanation of what distinguishes Homo sapiens from other species:

1.  Our ability to _collaborate collectively_ towards a common goal.
2.  Our capacity for abstract thought and _storytelling_, which has been the foundation for
    countless innovations. As Harari points out, everything ever built started as someone's
    imagination - an idea also explored by Sir Ken Robinson in "Imagine If"
3.  The development of _language_ (both written and spoken), which allowed us to exchange
    information (across borders and generations).

These unique aspects have allowed our species to create _complex societies_, develop
_advanced technologies_, and ultimately shape the world as we know it today. I highly
recommend "Sapiens" to anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of _human
history_. While it may challenge some preconceptions, it offers a thought-provoking journey
through the history of our species that I found both enlightening and engaging.


## Sociology and Current Affairs {#sociology-and-current-affairs}


### 📚 Triggerpunkte (Trigger Points) {#triggerpunkte--trigger-points}

👉 [Triggerpunkte - Konsens und Konflikt in der Gegenwartsgesellschaft](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199211943-triggerpunkte)

In the context of Europe's (and beyond) current political landscape, marked by a
noticeable _right-wing shift_, "**Triggerpunkte**" offers a insightful analysis of
_societal tensions_ in Germany. As someone who doesn't consider himself
politically active, I found myself increasingly concerned about the polarized
and extreme nature of political discourse in Germany. The rise of the _AfD_ to a
level of influence that seemed unthinkable just a few years ago exemplifies this
shift.

"Triggerpunkte" presents the findings of a team of sociologists (Steffen Mau,
Thomas Lux, Linus Westheuser) who conducted _empirical research_ across Germany.
What struck me about their approach was the diversity of their
[subject groups](https://brainfck.org/book/triggerpunkte/#klassenschema-nach-daniel-oesch):

-   Participants came from various "_political classes_"
-   They represented _different professions_ (teachers, handymen, business people, etc.)
-   The study included people from both _East and West Germany_

The researchers posed questions on controversed issues such as _immigration_,
_climate change_, _LGBTQ+ inclusion_, and _income inequality_ in Germany. By measuring
emotional responses, they identified topics with _high conflict potential_ across
different groups. They also explored _correlations_ between people's arguments and
factors like educational background, political affiliation, income, age, and
origin.

This book had a profound impact on me. It helped me understand the frustrations
many people have with the current German government, their fears about the
_impact_ of _climate change_ countermeasures, and why some perceive immigrants as a
significant threat. These insights are crucial for anyone trying to comprehend
the current political dynamics in Germany.

One of the most reassuring
[findings](https://brainfck.org/book/triggerpunkte/#politisierung-und-konflikt-in-der-gegenwartsgesellschaft)
from the study, in my opinion, was that overall, German society maintains:

-   A positive stance towards welcoming immigration policies
-   Support for better climate protection
-   A generally non-homophobic attitude

However, the study also revealed a _small group of individuals_
([Polarisierungsunternehmer](https://brainfck.org/book/https://brainfck.org/book/triggerpunkte/#polarisierungsunternehmer)),
some with political interests, propagate extreme arguments. These actors attempt
to influence mass media perception through _fake news_ and _whataboutism_, aiming to
create more _cleavages_ within the society. The authors' discussion of these
[cleavages](https://brainfck.org/book/triggerpunkte/#cleavages) was particularly enlightening.

Reading "Triggerpunkte" has given me a more nuanced understanding of the complex social
and political landscape in contemporary Germany. It's a crucial read for anyone seeking to
understand the underlying factors driving current political trends, not just in Germany
but potentially in other countries facing similar challenges.

## Health and Psychology {#health-and-psychology}


### 📚 When the Body Says No {#when-the-body-says-no}

👉 [When the Body Says No: The Cost of Hidden Stress (by Gabor Mate)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/450534.When_the_Body_Says_No)

My journey to Gabor Maté's work began with an interview I stumbled upon between
Maté and Guy Rose, host of "[London Real](https://londonreal.tv/)". I was immediately captivated by Maté's
clear and profound explanations on various aspects of _trauma_, which prompted me
to delve into his book, "When the Body Says No".

At the core of Maté's argument is the _inseparability_ of _body_, _soul_, and _mind_ - a
holistic view that challenges conventional medical approaches. Throughout the
book, Maté presents case studies from his medical practice, illustrating how
physical pains often have roots in (childhood) trauma that manifest as
chronic stress within patients.

One of the most enlightening aspects of the book is Maté's exploration of
_stress_, drawing on the work of [Hans Selye](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/338094.Hans_Selye). Maté uses Selye's definition to
provide a comprehensive understanding of stress and its various facets:

> In searching for a word to capture the meaning of the physical changes he
> observed in his experiments, Selye "stumbled upon the term stress, which had
> long been used in common English, and particularly in engineering, to denote the
> effects of a force acting against a resistance." He gives the example of changes
> induced in a stretched rubber band or in a steel spring under pressure. These
> changes may be noted with the naked eye or may be evident only on microscopic
> examination.
>
> Selye's analogies illustrate an important point: excessive stress occurs when
> the demands made on an organism exceed that organism's reasonable capacities to
> fulfill them. The rubber band snaps, the spring becomes deformed. The stress
> response can be set off by physical damage, either by infection or injury. It
> can also be triggered by emotional trauma or just by the threat of such trauma,
> even if purely imaginary. Physiological stress responses can be evoked when the
> threat is outside conscious awareness or even when the individual may believe
> himself to be stressed in a "good" way.

This definition of stress provides a crucial framework for understanding how
**emotional and psychological experiences can manifest in physical symptoms**. It
underscores Maté's central thesis that our mental and emotional states have
profound impacts on our physical health.

Maté's work challenges us to consider the long-term health implications of our
emotional experiences and the importance of addressing psychological well-being
as a key component of overall health.
