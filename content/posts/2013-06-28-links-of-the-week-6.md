This weeks links:

1.  [Self interview after leaving the NetBSD board][1]: I still like NetBSD a lot but what Julio writes in his blog makes me feel sad about the whole project.
2.  [Free Raspberry Pi Hosting][2]: Really interesting idea. I can't wait to see some day a whole P2P network build upon raspberry pi's.
3.  [Google Trends][3]: Get a real-time view on what's being searched on Google right now. Really impressive!
4.  [Learn Git Branching][4]: Learn how Git's branching really works. Also learn more about the concepts behind Git.
